#Image encryption and decryption

Image encryption and decryption using Python typically involves employing cryptographic algorithms to encode and decode image data. Single key encryption and decryption, also known as symmetric encryption, employs the same key for both encoding and decoding the information.

Decryption reverses this process: the ciphertext, along with the same key, is fed into the decryption algorithm, which produces the original image data. Without the correct key, decrypting the ciphertext is practically impossible, ensuring security.

However, while symmetric encryption is efficient and fast for data encryption, securely managing the key becomes crucial. Techniques like key exchange protocols or key derivation functions help mitigate this challenge.

To implement image encryption and decryption in Python, one would first read the image file, encrypt or decrypt the image data using a chosen symmetric encryption algorithm and key, and then write the processed image data back to a file. Testing and validation of the encryption and decryption processes are critical to ensure the security and integrity of the image data.
